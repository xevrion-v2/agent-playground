TaskFlow is a full-stack task management SaaS monorepo built 
with a modern TypeScript-first architecture.

## Workspace Structure

- `apps/web` — Next.js 14 App Router frontend
- `apps/api` — Express.js backend with layered REST API
- `packages/db` — Prisma schema and database package
- `packages/ui` — Shared UI components and utilities

## Frontend

The web app includes pages for:
- Landing
- Task boards and task detail
- Create a task
- User profiles and user search
- Client and freelancer dashboards
- Messaging
- Notifications
- Settings
- Billing
- Admin panel

## Backend

The API includes:
- Auth routes (register, login, OAuth callback, JWT refresh)
- CRUD routes for users, tasks, and proposals
- Payments routes (Stripe-focused service placeholder)
- Reviews, messaging, notifications
- File uploads and search
- Admin routes

Backend architecture follows:
- Middleware layer (auth, rate limiting, error handling)
- Controller layer
- Service layer
- Route layer
- Validation schemas (Zod)
- Utility helpers

### Run frontend

npm run dev -w apps/web

### Run backend

npm run dev -w apps/api

## Database

Prisma schema is available in packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma 
with models for:
- Users
- Tasks
- Proposals
- Payments
- Reviews
- Messages
- Categories
- Skills

## Environment Variables

Each app/package expects its own .env values for DB, auth, 
and integrations.

## Utilities

### Infinite Sequence Iterator

The `packages/ui` package provides an infinite sequence utility with safe iteration.

```typescript
import { infiniteSequence, take } from "@taskflow/ui";

// Natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
const naturals = infiniteSequence(0, n => n + 1);
console.log(take(naturals, 5)); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

// Even numbers: 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
const evens = infiniteSequence(0, n => n + 2);
for (const n of take(evens, 3)) {
  console.log(n); // 0, 2, 4
}
```

The `take` function safely consumes a limited number of values from an infinite sequence.
