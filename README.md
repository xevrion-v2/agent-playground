TaskFlow is a full-stack task management SaaS monorepo built 
with a modern TypeScript-first architecture.

## Workspace Structure

- `apps/web` — Next.js 14 App Router frontend
- `apps/api` — Express.js backend with layered REST API
- `packages/db` — Prisma schema and database package
- `packages/ui` — Shared UI components

## Frontend

The web app includes pages for:
- Landing
- Task boards and task detail
- Create a task
- User profiles and user search
- Client and freelancer dashboards
- Messaging
- Notifications
- Settings
- Billing
- Admin panel

## Backend

The API includes:
- Auth routes (register, login, OAuth callback, JWT refresh)
- CRUD routes for users, tasks, and proposals
- Payments routes (Stripe-focused service placeholder)
- Reviews, messaging, notifications
- File uploads and search
- Admin routes

Backend architecture follows:
- Middleware layer (auth, rate limiting, error handling)
- Controller layer
- Service layer
- Route layer
- Validation schemas (Zod)
- Utility helpers

## Getting Started

npm run test

### Run frontend

npm run dev -w apps/web

### Run backend

npm run dev -w apps/api

## Database

Prisma schema is available in packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma 
with models for:
- Users
- Tasks
- Proposals
- Payments
- Reviews
- Messages
- Categories
- Skills

## Environment Variables

Each app/package expects its own .env values for DB, auth, 
and integrations.

### Local App Variables

Create environment files only for the apps you run locally.

`apps/api/.env`:

```sh
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/taskflow"
JWT_SECRET="replace-with-a-local-development-secret"
```

`apps/web/.env.local`:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:4000"
```

The API reads `PORT` when starting the Express server. The database
package reads `DATABASE_URL` from the Prisma schema, and the web app
can use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for browser-safe API calls.
